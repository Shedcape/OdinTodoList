# Todolist

This is a small project to make a simple Todo List using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, as part of the Odin Project. 
The todo list includes the ability to make separate projects and in each of them create todos. The todos features titles, descriptions, priority and due dates.

## Built using

### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Webpack

### Tools
* Visual Studio Code
* Linux Terminal
* Git and Github
* Webpack

## Outcome

* Used HTML5 to create the structure
* Used CSS3 flex to create the layout
* Used Git and GitHub for project management
* Used JavaScript for functionality
* Used Webpack for development and compiling


### What I learned
* Better understanding of the dataset property to help transfer important information
* Better understanding of how to create HTML syntax in vanilla JavaScript using the InnerHTML attribute.

### What to improve
* To write cleaner code
* To learn CSS better. While the page is usable, and does that it sets out to do, it is not a looker. Coming up with a design on my own is a struggle. 
* That while I in theory understand more about object oriented programming, I have a lot to learn in that department. This project aimed to mainly use objects and classes for functionality, which it does, but not in the best way possible.

### To do
* Change color of a todo based on the priority selected. 
* Clean up code to make it more readable and clearer.
